### What Is It?

The Apache Tomcat® software is an open source implementation of the Java

technologies. The Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and
Java WebSocket specifications are developed under the
[Java Community Process](https://jcp.org/en/introduction/overview).

The Apache Tomcat software is developed in an open and participatory
environment and released under the
[Apache License version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/). The Apache Tomcat
project is intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from
around the world. We invite you to participate in this open development
project. To learn more about getting involved,

Apache Tomcat software powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web
applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations. Some of
these users and their stories are listed on the
[PoweredBy wiki page](https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/PoweredBy).
